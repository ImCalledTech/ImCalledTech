# About me
- 👋 Hey everyone!
- 🙋‍♂️ I am [@ImCalledTech](https://github.com/ImCalledTech) but you can just call me Tech
- 📱 Most of my socials are `ImCalledTech` or just `Tech` but some older ones that I cannot change are different (like my [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/ImCalledTech))
- 🧭 I am from the United Kingdom, so my timezone is GMT.
- 👀 I am interested in Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML and CSS
- 🎮 I also play [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net), [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/) and other indie games in my spare time.
- 💬 If you need to ask a question to me,  DM me on Discord at `imcalledtech`.
