# About me
- 👋 Hey everyone!
- 🙋‍♂️ I am [@ImCalledTech](https://github.com/ImCalledTech) but you can just call me Tech
- 📱 Most of my socials are `ImCalledTech` or just `Tech` but some older ones that I cannot change are different (like my [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/techplaysminecraft) or my [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/ImCalledTech))
- 🧭 I am from the United Kingdom, so my timezone is GMT (Greenwich Mean Time, which is UTC+00)
- 👀 I am interested in JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS and Java
- 🎮 I also play [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) in my spare time - mainly on the [Performium Network](https://www.performium.net) and sometimes on the [Hypixel Network](https://hypixel.net)
- 💬 If you need to ask a question to me, add me as a friend and then DM me on Discord at `Tech#3901`. Or you could just join my [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/FtS8dyJNnx)...
- 📖 Thank you for taking time out of your day to read my profile, I hope you have an **awesome** day!
